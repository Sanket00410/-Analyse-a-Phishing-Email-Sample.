# Phishing Email Analysis Project

## Task 2: Analyze a Phishing Email Sample

**Author:** Sanket Admile
**Date:** September 24, 2025  
**Objective:** Identify phishing characteristics in suspicious email samples  

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates comprehensive phishing email analysis skills through systematic examination of suspicious email samples. The analysis includes technical header verification, content assessment, and threat classification using industry-standard tools and methodologies.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify phishing characteristics in email samples
- Analyze email headers for authentication failures
- Assess social engineering tactics used by attackers
- Document findings with evidence and confidence levels
- Provide actionable threat assessment and recommendations

## 🛠️ Tools Used

### Free Online Header Analyzers
- **MXToolbox Email Header Analyzer** - SPF/DKIM/DMARC verification
- **Google Admin Toolbox** - Comprehensive header parsing
- **Microsoft Message Header Analyzer** - Authentication analysis
- **EasyDMARC Header Analyzer** - DNS record verification

### Analysis Tools
- Email client (for raw email examination)
- Text editor (for header analysis)
- CSV tools (for data organization)
- Documentation tools (Markdown)




## 🔍 Key Findings Summary

### Critical Indicators Identified:
- ✅ **Domain Spoofing** - Fake sender domain detected
- ✅ **Authentication Failures** - SPF/DKIM/DMARC all failed  
- ✅ **Malicious Attachments** - Double extension (.pdf.exe)
- ✅ **Social Engineering** - Urgency and fear tactics
- ✅ **Suspicious Links** - Redirects to malicious domains

### Threat Assessment:
- **Risk Level:** CRITICAL
- **Confidence:** 98%
- **Action Required:** IMMEDIATE DELETION AND REPORTING

# Phishing Email Analysis Project

## Task 2: Analyze a Phishing Email Sample

**Author:** Sanket Admile
**Date:** September 24, 2025  
**Objective:** Identify phishing characteristics in suspicious email samples  

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates comprehensive phishing email analysis skills through systematic examination of suspicious email samples. The analysis includes technical header verification, content assessment, and threat classification using industry-standard tools and methodologies.

## Objectives

- Identify phishing characteristics in email samples
- Analyze email headers for authentication failures
- Assess social engineering tactics used by attackers
- Document findings with evidence and confidence levels
- Provide actionable threat assessment and recommendations

##  Tools Used

### Free Online Header Analyzers
- **MXToolbox Email Header Analyzer** - SPF/DKIM/DMARC verification
- **Google Admin Toolbox** - Comprehensive header parsing
- **Microsoft Message Header Analyzer** - Authentication analysis
- **EasyDMARC Header Analyzer** - DNS record verification

### Analysis Tools
- Email client (for raw email examination)
- Text editor (for header analysis)
- CSV tools (for data organization)
- Documentation tools (Markdown)




##  Key Findings Summary

### Critical Indicators Identified:
-  **Domain Spoofing** - Fake sender domain detected
-  **Authentication Failures** - SPF/DKIM/DMARC all failed  
-  **Malicious Attachments** - Double extension (.pdf.exe)
-  **Social Engineering** - Urgency and fear tactics
-  **Suspicious Links** - Redirects to malicious domains

### Threat Assessment:
- **Risk Level:** CRITICAL
- **Confidence:** 98%
- **Action Required:** IMMEDIATE DELETION AND REPORTING

##  Analysis Results

|Indicator Category | Count | Risk Level |
|--------------------|------|------------|
| Critical           | 5   |High Impact |
| High               | 4 | Significant |
| Medium             | 3 | Moderate |
| Low                | 1 | Minimal |

**Total Indicators Found:** 13  
**Overall Threat Score:** 9.2/10

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

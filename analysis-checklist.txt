PHISHING EMAIL ANALYSIS CHECKLIST
==================================

## Pre-Analysis Setup
□ Secure analysis environment prepared
□ Analysis tools bookmarked and accessible
□ Documentation templates ready
□ Time allocated for thorough analysis (45-60 minutes)
□ Network monitoring disabled (to avoid accidentally clicking links)

## Phase 1: Initial Assessment (5 minutes)
□ Sender email address reviewed
□ Display name vs actual email compared
□ Subject line analyzed for urgency/threats
□ Initial risk level assigned (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL)
□ Decision made to proceed with full analysis

## Phase 2: Technical Header Analysis (10-15 minutes)
□ Complete email headers extracted
□ SPF (Sender Policy Framework) results checked
□ DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) results verified
□ DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication) compliance confirmed
□ Routing path examined for anomalies
□ Originating IP addresses verified
□ Timestamp analysis completed
□ Authentication failures documented

## Phase 3: Sender Analysis (5-10 minutes)
□ Domain spoofing techniques checked:
  □ Character substitution (0 for O, 1 for l, rn for m)
  □ Additional subdomains examined
  □ Alternative TLDs checked
  □ Typosquatting patterns identified
□ Display name mismatch documented
□ Sender authority verified (if known contact)
□ Normal communication patterns compared

## Phase 4: Content Analysis (10-15 minutes)
□ Language quality assessed:
  □ Spelling errors identified
  □ Grammar mistakes documented
  □ Unnatural phrasing noted
  □ Professional tone evaluated
□ Social engineering tactics identified:
  □ Fear-based language (account suspension, legal action)
  □ Urgency creation (deadlines, immediate action)
  □ Authority exploitation (executive, government, IT)
  □ Curiosity/greed appeals (prizes, exclusive offers)
□ Personalization level assessed:
  □ Generic vs specific greetings
  □ Use of recipient's actual name
  □ Reference to specific accounts/services
□ Brand impersonation techniques documented

## Phase 5: Link and Attachment Analysis (10 minutes)
**CRITICAL: NEVER CLICK SUSPICIOUS LINKS OR OPEN ATTACHMENTS**

□ Link analysis completed (hover only):
  □ URL destinations examined
  □ Domain reputation checked
  □ Shortened URLs expanded safely
  □ SSL certificate status noted
  □ Comparison with legitimate URLs done
□ Attachment analysis completed:
  □ File extensions verified (especially double extensions)
  □ File sizes checked for anomalies
  □ Attachment necessity assessed
  □ Sender authority to send attachments verified
  □ File scanning results documented (if available)

## Phase 6: Evidence Documentation (5-10 minutes)
□ Email headers preserved in full
□ Screenshots taken of email content
□ Link destinations documented (without accessing)
□ Attachment information recorded
□ Social engineering tactics catalogued
□ Technical evidence compiled
□ Analysis timestamps recorded

## Phase 7: Risk Assessment (5 minutes)
□ Individual indicator scores assigned
□ Category weights applied:
  □ Authentication Failure (25%)
  □ Domain Spoofing (20%)
  □ Malicious Payload (25%)
  □ Social Engineering (15%)
  □ Content Quality (10%)
  □ Sender Verification (5%)
□ Overall risk score calculated
□ Risk classification assigned:
  □ LOW (0-3): Likely legitimate
  □ MEDIUM (4-6): Suspicious, requires caution
  □ HIGH (7-8): Likely phishing, avoid interaction
  □ CRITICAL (9-10): Confirmed phishing, immediate action
□ Confidence level assessed (percentage)

## Phase 8: Response Actions
□ Immediate containment actions taken:
  □ No links clicked
  □ No attachments opened
  □ No replies sent
□ Reporting completed:
  □ IT Security team notified
  □ Anti-phishing services contacted
  □ Email provider reported (if applicable)
  □ Colleagues alerted (if targeted attack)
□ Email handling:
  □ Email documented before deletion
  □ Secure deletion completed
  □ Evidence preserved for investigation

## Quality Assurance Checklist
□ All authentication protocols verified
□ Multiple analysis tools used for cross-verification
□ Social engineering tactics thoroughly assessed
□ Risk scoring calculations double-checked
□ Evidence properly documented and preserved
□ Recommended actions clearly specified
□ Analysis time recorded for process improvement
□ Tool effectiveness noted for future reference

## Post-Analysis Learning
□ New phishing techniques identified and documented
□ Tool effectiveness assessed and recorded
□ Analysis methodology refined based on findings
□ Knowledge base updated with new indicators
□ Lessons learned documented for team sharing

## Common Red Flags Checklist
□ Authentication Failures:
  □ SPF: FAIL
  □ DKIM: FAIL
  □ DMARC: FAIL
□ Domain Spoofing Indicators:
  □ Character substitution (amaz0n.com)
  □ Additional subdomains (paypal.security-update.com)
  □ Foreign TLD (.ru, .tk, .ml)
  □ Suspicious registrar or creation date
□ Content Red Flags:
  □ "Dear Customer" or generic greeting
  □ Urgent action required language
  □ Threats of account closure/suspension
  □ Grammar/spelling errors
  □ Mismatched branding elements
□ Technical Red Flags:
  □ Suspicious originating IP
  □ Private IP in public routing
  □ Missing reverse DNS
  □ Unusual routing patterns
□ Behavioral Red Flags:
  □ Unexpected communication from known contact
  □ Requests outside normal patterns
  □ Bypass of normal approval processes
  □ Pressure for immediate action without verification

## Emergency Response Indicators
If ANY of these are detected, treat as CRITICAL threat:
□ Executable attachments (.exe, .scr, .bat)
□ Double file extensions (.pdf.exe, .doc.scr)
□ All authentication protocols failed
□ Known malicious domains in links
□ Active credential harvesting attempts
□ Ransomware indicators in attachments
□ CEO fraud/wire transfer requests
□ Mass distribution to organization

## Documentation Standards
□ Analysis start and end times recorded
□ All tools used documented with versions
□ Screenshots taken of key evidence
□ Chain of custody maintained
□ Confidence levels assigned to each finding
□ Risk scores calculated using standard methodology
□ Recommendations specific and actionable
□ Report formatted for professional presentation

## Final Verification
□ All checklist items completed
□ Evidence securely stored
□ Risk assessment validated
□ Actions taken documented
□ Lessons learned recorded
□ Report quality reviewed
□ Submission prepared for delivery
